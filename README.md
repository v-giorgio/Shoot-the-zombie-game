# SHOOT THE ZOMBIE 🧟
- A standard game version of shooting the target based on JavaScript, HTML e CSS.

### GOAL

- Shoot all the zombies that appear on the screen until the time runs out; 🧭

- You have three hearts ❤️❤️❤️ in the beginning of the game:

  - If you lose all three of them, you must not miss any more shots. If you do, you ***lose*** the game; 🏆
  
  - If you manage to not miss more than four shots before the time runs out, you ***win***. ❌
 
 ### MODES
 
 - There are three different game modes to be played:
 
    - **Normal** ☺️
    - **Hard** 😐
    - **Expert** 😓
 
 - They differ in terms of the ***amount of time required to survive the game*** and ***how fast the zombies appear and disappear*** on the screen.
